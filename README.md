## Real-Time Notifications

Admins can change notification timer from the dashboard (commented out CronSettings.jsx on AdminDashboard.jsx).
Daily email reminders are sent via Nodemailer + Cron if attendance is not marked.

## Charts & Reports
Admins get employee vs work-hours graphs by day, range, or all-time.
Employees get monthly attendance table + daily hours bar chart.

## Authentication & Roles
JWT-based login
Role-based UI rendering (Admin vs Employee)
Protected routes via custom middleware and frontend guards

## TODOs & Enhancements
Email templates with better design
Notifications on mobile (PWA)
Offline support (cache check-ins)
